# Image_Recognition

## Summary
Build an image recognition model that can classify images into different categories. Starting with a small dataset of images and use machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors or Decision Trees. This is the Building AI course project

## Background
Image recognition is a common application of artificial intelligence that involves training a machine learning model to recognize images and classify them into different categories. One possible example would be to train a model to recognize different types of animals, such as cats, dogs, and birds.

## Data and AI techniques
To get started we need to gather a dataset of images and their corresponding labels. It is possible to use some existing dataset like CIFAR-10, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. Alternatively, we could create our own dataset by downloading images from the internet and manually labeling them :-D

Next we'll need to preprocess data by resizing the images to a fixed size and normalizing the pixel values. This will help improve the performance of the model and make it easier to train.

Once data is preprocessed, we can start training the model using machine learning algorithms like K-nearest neighbors or Decision Trees. These algorithms are relatively simple and easy to implement, which makes them a good choice for beginners :)

## What next
After training the model, we can evaluate its performance by testing it on a set of validation images that it hasn't seen before. We can also use various performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to measure how well the model is doing.

## Acknowledgments
Overall image recognition is a great choice for beginners because it's a common application of AI and can be easily implemented using machine learning algorithms. Plus there are many different datasets and applications to choose from, so it can be customized project to fit anyones interests.
